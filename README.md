- vs code (for code development), React js,html,css,javascript( programming
languages), github (code storage and presentation), git (code transition to github).

# Steps to run/ build the project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Summarizing the approch for the task:
the was developed using react js with the
technology used vs code developing the project with the help of vs code and after that code will run and tested
and store in github trough git technology is used . to run this project we need to open the github repository and
check the link of readme filr and click on the link and run the project and see the result in the web page trough
your own extension like chrome and firefox,edge etc and check all the code evaluation and efficiency of the
code the project was developed by html and css and react js,JavaScript,and excited waiting about the results
what happens next and thanks for this opportunity i am and also improve my skills and knowledge further and
further.
