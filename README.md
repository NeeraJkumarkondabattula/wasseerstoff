# Wasseestroff Frontend Development Using ReactJS

# Technologies Stack/Libraries Used :
- vs code (for code development)
- React JS
- HTML & CSS
- JavaScript( programming language)
- Github ( for code storage and presentation), Git (code transition to github).

# Steps To Run/Build The Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:https://neerajkumarkondabattula.github.io/wasseerstoff/3000](https://neerajkumarkondabattula.github.io/wasseerstoff/) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Summarizing The Approch For Task :
The initial approach of project start with using technology VS code version 1.75, React Javascript, GitHub. Created a Navigation bar contains of div class as Logo, Search icon, Stactics, Overview as a reference link containing a web page displaying content of overview of main page, Dashboard, Analytics. Added basic CSS properities by giving a proper styling on adding margin and padding measurements that gives an accurate layout of webpage. Later, moved on to creating the main content featuring as divided two equal parts using flex property of CSS both on left and right sides, In first half of page(left) contains analising boxes which contains all the purchasers, sales and no of users, Added analysis box of both New users and Active users build dyanamically using JS, Refreshing page each time will start count of Users in Analysis box from zero(0). Basic property of adding world map contains 6 different places like Chicago, Berlin, Manaus, Queensland, Giza, Shanghai using absoulte positions to set up a content box of active users. Timeline data of Sales figures with its sale after flex boxes displays different sizes of bar graphs using gradient effect which works using JS. Hovering effect for each bar graph box is included in a particular div class applying CSS styling. Page contain Overview link refers a overview content box which indicates each year sales figures from month January to December displaying Sales, Users, Team, Product. Footer of webpage contains company logo at left and at right bottom of footer contains estabilished company year.
